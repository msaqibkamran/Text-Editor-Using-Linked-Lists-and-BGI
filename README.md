# Features

BGI graphics is to create something similar with limited featues which are as follows:

 When the user types a data input key such as an alphabet, number or symbol, a textNode with the corresponding character is added immediately after the node pointed to by the cursor and the cursor is moved one step forward. 
• When the user presses the backspace key the node pointed to by the cursor is removed and the cursor moves one step back.
• The user should be able to use the direction keys to move the cursor within the text without editing the text. Note: vertical direction keys will move cursor within lines.
• The user should be able to insert a new line wherever she wishes in text. Note that a new line is nothing but a character as far as the text is concerned, but it is displayed is a special way.
• Using the Shift + direction keys the user should be able to select the text. She should be able to use Ctrl+X, Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V to cut, copy and paste segments of text to any point of their choice within the text.
• User should be able to find Ctrl+F and replace Ctrl+R text. In this case a small window (maybe near the bottom of the screen) should ask the user for the text to be found and the new text to replace it.
• When the screen is filled with text the user should be able to keep writing and scroll up and down in the text. The program should paginate the text.
• User should be able to save and load the text to and from .txt files.
